<hr>
<p>This is a mod that will make the fret buttons on your guitar hero controller firmer and more responsive. You get less of that clicking / rattling sound you get when you're playing fast, and it requires less downward pressure to fret a note.</p>
<h1>You will need:</h1>
<ul>
<li class="">Guitar Hero controller</li>
<li class="">Small philips screwdriver</li>
<li class="">Large-ish flat screwdriver</li>
<li class="">Duct tape (I used painters tape)</li>
<li class="">Scissors</li>
</ul>
<p>This idea originally is not originally mine, but the applications I used were different than most guides so I am including it here :)</p>

<p>After removing the neck from the guitar body, remove all the screws from it (excluding the one holding on the strap button, unless you don't use it, and want to remove it - I did here).</p>

<p>First, remove the two screws holding the brown circuit board down, using a small philips screwdriver.</p>
<p>Carefully lift the circuit board and set it aside. Be particularly careful not to trap or fold the ribbon cable at any point as it's quite delicate.</p>
<p>Remove the  rubber pad from the buttons, and set it aside - this will reveal the fret buttons. You can now remove these too.</p>

<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(2, 1fr);gap:2rem;margin-top:2rem"><figure id="fig-1" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/ghs4-c8ade134e433223622bea1d898282fa5.jpg" alt="Iteration 1" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"></figcaption></figure><figure id="fig-1" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/ghs5-d4d93026860484ef721bf68a2d2d31cf.jpg" alt="Iteration 1" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Start by sticking two pieces of duct tape together, adhesive sides facing each other. This is what the spacers are made out of.</p>
<p>Personally I found 2 layers of tape was perfect, but if you feel more is needed (or you are using tape of a different thickness) then use more or fewer layers. I would suggest 2 to start with - if 2 is too much (you'll be able to tell this after reassembling the guitar and playing with it) then I would suggest buying some thinner tape and using that.</p>
<p>Cut strips of the tape that are 1.5cm wide. Then cut these every 2cm until you get 5 pieces of tape that measure 1.5 x 2cm.</p>
<p>Lay each one on a button to make sure that you're cutting was accurate, and there are no overlaps - the spacer should fit completely on the button, with no overhangs. If so, the button's movement may be impaired.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="step-4-attatch-spacers">Step 4: Attatch Spacers<a href="https://catsyzz.me/design-processes/gh-mod#step-4-attatch-spacers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 4: Attatch Spacers" title="Direct link to Step 4: Attatch Spacers" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(2, 1fr);gap:2rem;margin-top:2rem"><figure id="fig-1" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/ghs6-cac4d823c4af9499c9842956c0f57462.jpg" alt="Iteration 1" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"></figcaption></figure><figure id="fig-1" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/ghs7-6768c0f531da6e30d5589ccb8e973282.jpg" alt="Iteration 1" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Make 5 small balls of your blu-tack (or equivalent, I used folded tape). Don't make these too big as too much will make the spacer's surface uneven - see the picture for an idea of size.</p>
<p>Roll one small sections of tape between your fingers to make a sausage shape, and press it along the center line and 2 holes in the plastic on the back of one of the fret buttons. Then attach a spacer to this, ensuring it is central to the button and not overlapping the sides at all.</p>
<p>Do this for all five buttons.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="step-5-reassemble-the-fret-button-assembly">Step 5: Reassemble the Fret Button Assembly<a href="https://catsyzz.me/design-processes/gh-mod#step-5-reassemble-the-fret-button-assembly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 5: Reassemble the Fret Button Assembly" title="Direct link to Step 5: Reassemble the Fret Button Assembly" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="buttons w spacer" src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/ghs8-3999aa28c6172372f8b3b9b0aea67be1.jpg" width="3024" height="4032" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Place the fret buttons back into the neck, in the correct order. The correct order (starting from the head of the guitar) is green, red, yellow, blue, orange.</p>
<p>Lay the blue rubber piece over the buttons, pressing it into place, and ensuring it is fitted correctly.</p>
<p>Line up the circuit board and gently press each end to get the plastic screw posts through the holes in the circuit board. Then put the screws you removed earlier back in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="back tape" src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/ghs9-8b38ebba579a0e4964d46e6a322694f5.jpg" width="4032" height="3024" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Along with this, the plastic on the back half of the neck is supposed to sandwich the circuit board to stop it bending. Despite this, i found that if you press a button hard, the circuit board will still bend to some degree, causing the buttons to move in a bit more than they should.</p>
<p>So to make the buttons firmer still, add a length of duct tape (torn to a smaller width) to the back of the circuit board as seen in the picture. This seems to help quite a lot in my opinion.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="step-6-reassemble-guitar">Step 6: Reassemble Guitar<a href="https://catsyzz.me/design-processes/gh-mod#step-6-reassemble-guitar" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 6: Reassemble Guitar" title="Direct link to Step 6: Reassemble Guitar" translate="no">​</a></h2>

<p>Replace the rear half of the neck, ensuring that the ribbon cable doesn't get trapped between the screw posts. If it does you could damage the wires inside.</p>
<p>Put all 9 screws back in using the Torx screwdriver.</p>
<p>Reattach the neck to the guitar, and test it to make sure everything works. If the movement is too restricted, use thinner tape. If you want to reduce movement more, then make more spacers, but using 3 layers of tape instead of 2.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>]]></content>

<p>For real world engineering notebooks its ...</p>
<p>My experience working with them has mainly been through Vex, or Vex Robotics Competition, where the <strong>engineering notebook</strong> serves as a season-long (year long), journal that documents a robotics team's <strong>engineering design process</strong>. It serves as a tool for reflection, iteration, and resource management for the team as it allows them to create and use a management framework for their operations.</p>
<h1>Key Parts of an engineering notebook</h1>
<p>The major parts of the notebooks in vex were focused on the 6 steps of the E.D.P:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Defining the problem:</strong> Typically refering to game or design challenges in context of vex</li>
<li class=""><strong>Brainstorming and reasearching solutions:</strong> Researching and brainstorming design and solution options</li>
<li class=""><strong>Selecting the best solution and Planning for it:</strong> Picking the best brainstormed solutions and creating living and working timeline for accomplishing said goal, allocating reasources as neccesary</li>
<li class=""><strong>Building the solution:</strong> Constructing said solution</li>
<li class=""><strong>Testing the solution:</strong> Running structrued tests to gain quantative data to then compare and contrast its performance to other designs/robots</li>
<li class=""><strong>Repeating process as neccesary:</strong> If tests come up different than expected, repeat process by defining new problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Process can be applied outside of just VRC engineering, as it is the main framework for problem solving as an engineer in a  professional setting.</p>

<p>Well since the E.D.P is a problem solving process, it was applied to come up with a robot design for every season I competed in. We would always begin in the linear structure of teh rubric, which followed each step chronologically.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="defining-the-problem">Defining the Problem<a href="https://catsyzz.me/design-processes/notebook-progression#defining-the-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Defining the Problem" title="Direct link to Defining the Problem" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>For us to accurately define the problem for a game overall, analyzing the information that was presented was essential to success. We split this up into two main ways: <strong>quantative analysis</strong>, and <strong>strategical analysis</strong>. Our two main focuses were how we could maximize point scoring by analyzing how to score points and weighing which played more importance to us, then how these decisions would affect possible match, autonomous, and skills match strategies.</p>

<p>In brainstorming, I would always try to throw out every idea I had initially, no matter how outrageous, and then finish by condensing it to three realistic concepts. I would collaborate with other teams on discord like the <strong>Vex Learning Alliance</strong> or the <strong>SoCal Robotics Alliance</strong> to bounce ideas off of other high performing teams and like minded individuals. From there, I would usually scour Youtube or BiliBili to become inspired by national and international teams to finalize a few ideas. Below you can see examples of this research from past notebooks.</p>

<h1>Intro to High Stakes</h1>
<p>This year’s competition challenge was centered around developing a robot capable of scoring rings, manipulating mobile goals around a field, and elevating itself at the end of a match.</p>
<p>With this in mind, when analyzing the field, there is:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Forty-eight (48) Rings</li>
<li class="">Five (5) Mobile Goals</li>
<li class="">Four (4) Wall Stakes</li>
<li class="">One (1) Ladder</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Field diagram" src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/highstakesfield-ad99ed2723624e9c3f3a4f13633cb3bc.png" width="318" height="217" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>One side of the Field Perimeter is marked with:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Two (2) Positive Corners</li>
<li class="">Two (2) Negative Corners</li>
</ul>
<p>Points can be scored on any kind of <strong>Stake</strong> throughout the field using blue and red <strong>Rings</strong> placed throughout the field. Six (6) Rings can fit on any given stake (except Wall Stakes, which can only fit two).</p>

<p>Early in the season, I began researching robot designs and identified four essential components:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">An intake</li>
<li class="">A clamp for mobile goals</li>
<li class="">A mechanism to score on stakes other than mobile goals</li>
<li class="">A method for elevation during the endgame</li>
</ul>
<p>The first robot design I developed only featured two of these four goals. Due to time constraints, I accepted the trade-off and moved forward with a simplified build.</p>

<p>I decided to use a standard drivetrain speed of 480 RPM using a 36-48 (19:24) gear ratio on 2.75" omni wheels and an offset traction wheel. This was a drivetrain I was very comfortable using since it was similar to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Spin Up</a> season drive train at worlds.</p>

<h1>Intake and Clamp Mechanism</h1>
<p>I decided to design a conveyer-style intake inspired by my previous experience in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Tipping Point</a> intaking rings, using "hooks" to grab onto each ring and flip them onto goals to score them.</p>
<p>For the clamp mechanism, I was inspired by collaborating with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@theflyingcuber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">VURC Team OSCR</a> in designing this clamp and implementing it onto the robot.</p>

<p>Despite its limitations, this robot performed well in competition, earning qualifying awards and securing our placement at the state level early in the season.</p>
<h1>V1.1</h1>
<p>After the first two competitions, we attempted to add a lift mechanism inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXMNPDNUUeU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">MJS Lift Mechanism</a>. The goal was to score on Wall Stakes and Alliance Stakes. Unfortunately, the design was only tested for two days before being scrapped in favor of planning the next iteration.</p>

<p>Our second iteration was one of our most successful builds, competing in three events. It achieved three out of the four original goals and introduced a new lift mechanism known as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0qKV4nqYBG8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">"Lady Brown" mechanism</a>.</p>
<h1>Lady Brown Mechanism</h1>
<p>Planning:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Wanted to use CAD to create correct geometry for loading and scoring</li>
<li class="">Wanted to use minimal metal to reduce weight for competition robot</li>
<li class="">Needed to be fast enough to...</li>
</ul>
<p>This mechanism was designed to intercept rings during intake and rotate them into scoring position on Wall Stakes. In order for this design to work, it neede to have correct geometry relative to the intake and the wall stake, because common issues we found while testing was the lift being able to grab the ring,  but not score it, or that it could score but not grab the rings.</p>

<p>The tuning and troubleshooting for this design focused on the plastic pieces and mesh that the mechanism used (shown below):</p>
<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(0, 1fr);gap:2rem;margin-top:2rem"><figure id="fig-1" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/highstakeslbmesh-6283ebdc12cae4852f007353d05db5ee.png" alt="Iteration 1" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"><p>I came up with solutions using different amounts of mesh and rubber bands to dictate the "hold" of the arm.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Throughout the season, we continued with this method for other iterations of the arm.</p>
<h1>Improved Clamp</h1>
<p>When deciding to make changes for this design compared to <strong>V1.0</strong>, we realized the general idea of a locking clamp worked extremely well in competition. To reduce weight, we redesigned a sleeker clamp. The locking clamp helped secure mobile goals and supported our strategy of goal stealing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Clamp image" src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/highstakesclamp1-1891702806e4e7cb86a99efc7ed8ccbd.jpg" width="3024" height="4032" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>To make the clamp lock, we opted to use an <strong>over-centered joint</strong> to ensure that the pistons pushing the mechanism would not fail to hold the goal even while scoring rings. Because of this decision, we were able to "out-clamp" other robots and actually steal goals from there, making us known for this kind of defensive play worldwide.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Robot Iteration 3" src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/highstakesit4-a59ea4b1d3d86dddf9eb7bdaefdfd82e.jpg" width="4284" height="5712" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>For the fourth iteration of the robot, we wanted to optimize the build of the robot. The other two iterations have proven to be succesful in concept, all having a <strong>clamp, intake, and lift</strong> so I opted to do a complete overhaul fo the design to test out some new ideas, since we had a large gap before state championships</p>
<h1>Design Challenges</h1>
<p>With this design I focused on redoing three main components:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">The drive</li>
<li class="">The clamp</li>
<li class="">The lift</li>
</ul>
<h1>New Drivetrain</h1>
<p>For this new drive, we wanted to test a drive speed I was familiar with competing in the Over Under Season, having a 450 RPM drive speed on 3.25" wheels roughly coming out to ~8.1 Ft/s. This was a big increase in overall speed, but after studying other competitions and our own experience, we knew how great of a factor having manuverability throughout the field was so we opted to redesign to this speed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="drive v3" src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/highstakes3dt-495eca876df4b1e53d615dec9f75a0f9.jpg" width="4032" height="3024" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This drive was a big change, as it not only changed the speed, but it also had a new center of gravity to manage. This game challenge required you to carry a varying mobile goal on your back, so some of the initial issues was whenever we moved it would feel like a big weight on our backs swinging us around. In order to solve this, we replaced the center omni wheels for traction wheels to regain more control.</p>
<h1>New Lady Brown</h1>
<p>After collaborating with some friends from other teams through a discord community I helped to manage (<strong>Vex Learning Alliance</strong>), we concluded that shifting out Lady Brown mechanism to not just have a limited rotation, which it currently did to maximize effectiveness on wall stakes, to instaed have a full 360 degree rotation for greater versatility.</p>
<p>This decision was based on the idea that we could:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Flip/unflip goals from opponents in matches</li>
<li class="">Score more effectively on wall Stakes</li>
<li class="">We could also score on the alliance stake without just using our intake.</li>
</ul>
<p>For designing this, we opted to continue using the cad design mentioned earlier, creating a master sketch that included the new geomtery we needed for our wheels and the new mesh that would be needed for another idea I had.</p>
<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(2, 1fr);gap:2rem;margin-top:2rem"><figure id="fig-1" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/highstakeslb3-2cfb5fb1884c83e7d2e2bd22b4df7241.jpg" alt="Iteration 1" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"><p>Full ROM of new arm</p></figcaption></figure><figure id="fig-2" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/highstakeslb3mesh-e50e3dc7ad8d2bbaa9a27aa9acca82b4.jpg" alt="Iteration 2" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"><p>Mesh and Ring holder</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>When planning for our new arm, we were mainly focused qualifying to worlds through the skills challlenge, <em>a 60 second version of the game challenge where you play solo as opposed to 2v2</em>, and realized that the highest scoring routes score two rings ont he outside wall stakes instaed of just one for top ring value, so we wanted to design a <strong>double ring holder</strong> on our lady brown to cut this time deficit and maximize our efficeincy.</p>
<h1>New Clamp</h1>
<p>While our previous designs of having a locking clamp on our robot were effective, we realized that it was also very heavy. So we opted to redesign into a simpler design based on our friends at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@6627X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">6627X</a> with their design for a clamp below.</p>
<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(2, 1fr);gap:2rem;margin-top:2rem"><figure id="fig-1" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/zainclamp-109ac146dc2b6ccc6e6f8226060bb912.png" alt="Iteration 1" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"><p>6627X Clamp</p></figcaption></figure><figure id="fig-2" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/highstakes3clamp1-53500fb4e2648cbe909fc49be9f02dc8.jpg" alt="Iteration 2" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"><p>My Clamp</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>So, for our design we came up with this since it fit our robots geometry best while maximizing the weight reduced.</p>
<p>Overall, these changes helped our robot to perform significantly well as we prepared to test in competition and scrimmages throughout the next few months.</p>

<p><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RBLASxhf9kDQT6HdA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">This robot is included in the same folder as 3.0</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Dewey Sweep" src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/highstakesbot-cf3b209cdeed215249914ac770be7d71.jpg" width="1797" height="1474" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>After competing with the new drive train, we opted that it was a good solution to speed, the issue was the control. Along with this, I concluded the tradeoff for having the double lady brown was not worth the effectiveness in matches, since it was not effective at descoring rings which were essential in maintaining control of the high stakes</p>
<h1>Design Choices</h1>
<p>So because of this, we opted to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Revert the drive to the old 3.25" wheels</li>
<li class="">Revert the lady brown to be single hold</li>
<li class="">Redo the hold for the lady brown</li>
<li class="">Add odometry functionality to the robot for consistency</li>
</ul>
<h1>Lady Brown changes</h1>
<p>We had found at our recent competition, that despite the double lady brown being effective, it could be better remaining single and simply doing the motion twice for scoring. Because of this, I redesigned the plastic holder and the method for holding rings, using a foam strip instead of the typical mesh and rubber band combo.</p>

<h1>Odometry Implementation</h1>
<p>Odometry is a method for tracking a robot’s position and orientation on the field using sensor data. By measuring how far wheels have rotated and combining that with heading information (often from an inertial sensor), the robot can calculate its exact location in real time — like GPS, but self-contained.</p>
<p><em>In VEX, odometry typically uses:</em></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Tracking wheels</strong> (often unpowered) to measure linear movement</li>
<li class=""><strong>Inertial sensors (IMU Encoders)</strong> to track rotation</li>
<li class=""><strong>Math algorithms</strong> (trigonometry + vector updates) to compute position</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup allows your robot to know its coordinates and angle at any moment during autonomous routines.</p>
<p><em>Implementing odometry assists in:</em></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Precise autonomous navigation</strong> — no more guesswork or dead reckoning</li>
<li class=""><strong>Smooth path following</strong> — even curved or complex routes</li>
<li class=""><strong>Consistent performance</strong> — across matches and field conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of relying solely on timed movements or encoder values, odometry lets your robot adapt and correct its path dynamically. That’s a game-changer for skills runs and advanced autonomous strategies.</p>
<p>Example autonomous routines with and without odometry:</p>
<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(2, 1fr);gap:2rem;margin-top:2rem"><figure id="fig-1" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/pidauto-f67dce4955de63c103ccd28cbb46ab30.gif" alt="Iteration 1" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"><p>Only using PID functionality, relative movements</p></figcaption></figure><figure id="fig-2" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/odomauto-999b62e553a0bb06981a35412aca1475.gif" alt="Iteration 2" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"><p>Implementation of odometry, absolute movements</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>For the implementation of this onto the robot, we had to design trackign wheels for the robot, in which we designed custom plastic and custom metal pieces to house the trackign wheels with each neccesary rotation sensor.</p>
<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(3, 1fr);gap:2rem;margin-top:2rem"><figure id="fig-1" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/odommount1-7262e26bc51b9f41eb90d3ad42ff4cb9.jpg" alt="Iteration 1" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"></figcaption></figure><figure id="fig-2" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/odommount2-64c49d09d07606cf0b02785a05a072fc.jpg" alt="Iteration 2" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"><p>Odom Pod Mounting</p></figcaption></figure><figure id="fig-1" style="margin:0"><img src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/odommount3-d6bb20669eabd90abf8c546ddeb3558f.jpg" alt="Iteration 1" style="width:100%"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0.5rem;font-style:italic"></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>With the implementation of this function, I was able to maintain consistent autonomous routines and position trackings throughout the competitions we took this robot too</p>

<p>For this iteration of the robot, I opted for a complete overhaul of the design, to reduce weight and to redo the gemotry of our intake, clamp, and lift. Along with this, we wanted to add a hanging mechanism, so I deisnged custom plastic to optimize the angle for it.</p>
<h1>Design Planning</h1>
<ul>
<li class="">New bot from scratch</li>
<li class="">Reduce weight as much as possible in main structures</li>
<li class="">Implement custom plastic throughout the robot</li>
<li class="">Implement mechanism for elevation</li>
</ul>
<h1>Designing new robot</h1>
<p>For designing the new robot, I wanted to keep the same general idea dn geometry since it had worked for us on our last robot, simply changing the pieces used to reduce weight. To accomplish this I designed the full robot in CAD before building it which is shown below</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Full bot cad" src="https://catsyzz.me/assets/images/caseycad1-6708fb340cb73f9582575c8ee856cae5.png" width="799" height="716" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This cad only served as a hypothetical piece, as most of the plastic on the real robot was redone (but i dont have access to the file anymore) and so I began building it in the short 1 week period I had</p>
<h1>Custom plastic</h1>
<p>A more in depth overview of how this was developed can be found at <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/LcjJyR2y14UPvnTc6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Creating Custom Plastic with Laser Cutting and CNC</a> however this was the finished product for the plastic I developed which was used in the:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Structure of the robot towers for intake and lsit</li>
<li class="">Intake structure and wedge for rings</li>
<li class="">Ring hold for lift</li>
<li class="">Ring Drive wedges</li>
<li class="">And more</li>
</ul>

<p>These were mounted onto the robot with a combination of aluminum nuts and plastic screws, which both served to reduce weight compared to all hardware being steel.</p>
<h1>Testing and Finished Robot</h1>
<p>Throughout the constructing process, I was worried about robot functionality, and thus I extensively tested each mechanism in different simulations to ensure that isseus would not occur during matches or during our skills routine. Not only this, but my programmer and good friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-lopez-39715527a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Matthew Sarzoza</a> wanted to maximize effieincy of our programming section, so he worked tirelessly to provide 100+ programmign test runs to ensure efficiency and consistency.</p>

<p>These implementations allowed for the optimal structure since everything was integrated with each other, maximizing redundancy for structural integrities.</p>
